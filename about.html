    <h1>About Me</h1>
    
    <p>Hello! I'm Chase, a passionate web developer and a student at Utah State University, majoring in Information Systems. I’ve always been fascinated by technology and its ability to solve real-world problems. Over the years, I’ve cultivated a deep interest in coding, project management, and web development. My goal is to create intuitive, user-friendly websites and applications that can help individuals and businesses thrive in the digital world.</p>

    <p>Aside from my academic pursuits, I enjoy exploring new programming languages and tools. I’ve worked with several technologies, including Python, Flask, and HTML/CSS, and am constantly learning and improving my skills. I love the challenge of solving complex problems and building things from scratch. My background in both technology and problem-solving gives me a unique perspective on how to approach different development tasks, ensuring that I can always find the most efficient and effective solution.</p>

    <p>When I’m not coding or studying, you can often find me indulging in my other interests. I have a deep love for reading, particularly history and political science, and I enjoy exploring how different historical events shaped the modern world. Additionally, I’m an avid sports fan and enjoy playing fantasy football, which is a fun way to test my strategic thinking and decision-making skills. I believe that both my academic and personal interests contribute to my overall growth, and I try to find connections between them whenever possible.</p>

    <p>Through my website, I hope to showcase my work, projects, and ideas. I believe that a website is a great platform for sharing what I’ve learned and connecting with like-minded individuals. Whether you’re interested in technology, web development, or just want to get to know me a little better, I encourage you to explore the different sections of my site. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions, want to collaborate on a project, or simply want to chat about tech!</p>
